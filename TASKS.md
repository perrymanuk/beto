# Tasks

This file tracks high-level development tasks for the RadBot project. For detailed implementation information, refer to documentation in the `docs/implementation/` directory.

## üîÑ Current Status

All main modules are implemented and integrated. The agent consolidation has been completed with a single source of truth approach where:
- `/radbot/agent/agent.py` - Core implementation 
- `/radbot/agent.py` - Module interface wrapper
- `/agent.py` - Web entry point
