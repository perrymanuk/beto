# Crawl4AI Integration Fix

## Issue

When using the `crawl4ai_ingest_url` function, users were encountering the following error even though the API was successfully scraping content:

```
message: "Failed to ingest content: No content found"
```

## Investigation

Testing revealed that the Crawl4AI API was functioning correctly, but the API response structure was different than expected:

1. Our code was looking for content in the `"content"` field of the response
2. The actual API was returning content in the `"markdown"` field instead

This inconsistency caused our code to report "No content found" despite the API successfully returning the scraped content.

## Solution

We updated the `mcp_crawl4ai_client.py` file to check for content in both the `"content"` and `"markdown"` fields:

```python
# Check if we have content in the response - could be in "content" or "markdown" field
markdown_content = None

if result and "content" in result:
    markdown_content = result["content"]
    logger.info(f"Found content in 'content' field for {url}")
elif result and "markdown" in result:
    markdown_content = result["markdown"]
    logger.info(f"Found content in 'markdown' field for {url}")

if markdown_content:
    # Process the content as before
    ...
```

This flexible approach ensures our code works correctly regardless of which field name the API uses to return the content.

## Testing

We created a dedicated test script `test_crawl4ai_direct.py` that makes direct API calls to verify:

1. The API connection is successful
2. The API is returning content in the `"markdown"` field
3. The content is properly structured and usable

This fix ensures all `crawl4ai` functions work correctly with the current API format.
