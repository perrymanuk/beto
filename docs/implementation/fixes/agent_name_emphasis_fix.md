# Agent Name Emphasis Fix

## Overview

This document describes a fix for issues encountered with agent transfers in the web interface, where the LLM sometimes fails to use the exact agent name for transfers to built-in agents.

## Issue

Even though the technical implementation of agent transfers was corrected in the codebase and tests passed, we observed that in the web interface, the main agent (beto) sometimes responded to requests for code execution with messages like:

```
Sorry, my dude, but I can't transfer you to "code_execution_agent". It's like, not on my list of agents, know what I mean?
```

This indicates that while the agent transfer functionality was technically implemented correctly, the LLM wasn't consistently using the exact agent names required by the ADK framework.

## Root Cause

1. ADK 0.4.0 requires exact name matching for agent transfers
2. The LLM sometimes referred to agents with slight variations or didn't use the precise name required
3. The agent instruction didn't emphasize the importance of exact name matching
4. We weren't using ADK 0.4.0's proper method for registering sub-agents in the agent tree
5. Agents need to be properly added to the tree using add_sub_agent or similar methods

## Implementation

### 1. Agent Instructions

We modified the agent instructions to explicitly emphasize the importance of exact agent names:

```python
search_instruction = """
You can perform web searches using the Google Search tool through a sub-agent.
To use this capability, transfer control to the search_agent:
- transfer_to_agent(agent_name="search_agent")

The search agent has access to Google Search and can find up-to-date information
from the web. Use this for current events, recent information, or any factual
queries that may have changed since your training.

IMPORTANT: The search agent must be referred to EXACTLY as "search_agent" 
in the transfer_to_agent function call. This name is case-sensitive and must match exactly.
"""
```

Similar emphasis was added for the code execution agent as well.

### 2. Agent Tree Registration

We updated how built-in agents are registered in the agent tree:

```python
# Use the proper ADK agent.add_sub_agent method to register it
if hasattr(agent.root_agent, 'add_sub_agent'):
    agent.root_agent.add_sub_agent(code_agent)
    logger.info(f"Registered code_execution_agent using add_sub_agent method for ADK 0.4.0 compatibility")
elif hasattr(agent.root_agent, 'sub_agents'):
    # Fallback: add to sub_agents list manually
    if not any(sa.name == "code_execution_agent" for sa in agent.root_agent.sub_agents if hasattr(sa, 'name')):
        agent.root_agent.sub_agents.append(code_agent)
        logger.info(f"Added code_execution_agent to root_agent.sub_agents list")
else:
    # Last resort: use the register function
    register_code_execution_agent(agent.root_agent)
    logger.info(f"Registered Code Execution agent with parent {name} using register function")
```

This implementation tries multiple approaches to ensure the agent is properly registered in the agent tree:

1. First, try to use ADK 0.4.0's `add_sub_agent` method (preferred)
2. If that's not available, add the agent directly to the sub_agents list
3. As a last resort, fall back to our custom register function

## Key Changes

1. Added explicit IMPORTANT statements in the agent instructions emphasizing exact name matching
2. Made sure the instruction includes the exact string to use in the transfer_to_agent call
3. Emphasized that the name is case-sensitive and must match exactly
4. Modified how built-in agents are registered in the agent tree to use ADK 0.4.0's proper agent.add_sub_agent method
5. Added multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure proper agent tree structure

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:

1. Starting the web interface
2. Asking the agent to execute Python code (should trigger transfer to code_execution_agent)
3. Asking the agent to search for something (should trigger transfer to search_agent)

## Lessons Learned

1. In agent systems with strict naming requirements, it's important to explicitly emphasize those requirements in the agent instructions
2. LLMs may sometimes paraphrase or slightly modify values unless explicitly instructed not to
3. Even when code tests pass, real-world usage with LLMs may require additional guardrails and explicit instructions

This fix complements the technical implementation of agent transfers by making sure the LLM understands the importance of exact name matching in the transfer_to_agent function calls.
