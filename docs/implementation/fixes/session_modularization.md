# Session Module Modularization

## Problem

The `radbot/web/api/session.py` file had grown to over 1000 lines of code, making it difficult to maintain and understand. The file contained numerous responsibilities including:

- Session management with ADK
- Runner initialization and configuration 
- Event processing for different ADK event types
- Memory API integration
- WebSocket communication
- MCP tools loading
- Event data serialization

This monolithic structure made the file difficult to navigate, maintain, and extend.

## Solution

We refactored the monolithic `session.py` file into a proper package with multiple, focused module files:

- `session/__init__.py` - Package exports and documentation
- `session/session_runner.py` - The main SessionRunner class for managing ADK Runner instances
- `session/session_manager.py` - The SessionManager class for managing multiple sessions
- `session/event_processing.py` - Functions for processing different ADK event types
- `session/utils.py` - Utility functions for response processing and timestamps
- `session/memory_api.py` - Memory API and routes for storing memories
- `session/dependencies.py` - FastAPI dependencies for session and runner management 
- `session/serialization.py` - Serialization utilities for handling complex objects
- `session/mcp_tools.py` - MCP tools loading functionality

The original `session.py` file now acts as a facade that imports and re-exports the components from the individual modules.

## Implementation Details

The refactoring was implemented using a dedicated script (`tools/split_session_module.py`) that:

1. Extracts different components from the original file using regex patterns
2. Creates the appropriate directory structure
3. Adds proper imports and file headers to each module
4. Updates imports between modules to maintain functionality
5. Replaces the original file with a simplified facade that imports from the new modules

We also fixed a few implementation issues:

1. Fixed circular references between modules
2. Updated import statements to avoid circular dependencies
3. Fixed method references in event processing functions
4. Ensured proper error handling in all try/except blocks

## Benefits

This modularization provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Each module now has a single responsibility and is easier to understand
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to specific parts of the session system can be made in isolation
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Each file is now under 300 lines of code
4. **Clearer Dependencies**: The import structure makes dependencies between components explicit
5. **Easier Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
6. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the session system simultaneously

## Usage

All public components are re-exported through the original `session.py` file, so existing code that imports from `radbot.web.api.session` will continue to work without changes. For new code, you can either:

- Import from the facade: `from radbot.web.api.session import SessionRunner`
- Import directly from the module: `from radbot.web.api.session.session_runner import SessionRunner`

The `web/app.py` module was updated to use a proper factory pattern with a `create_app()` function to make testing easier.

## Future Work

This modularization makes it easier to:

1. Add additional API endpoints for session management
2. Improve event handling for different event types
3. Extend memory functionality
4. Add unit tests for specific components
5. Further refine the session runner implementation
