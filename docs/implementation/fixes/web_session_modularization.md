# Web Session Modularization

The large `session.py` file in the web API has been split into smaller, more maintainable modules to improve code organization and readability.

## Problem

The `radbot/web/api/session.py` file had grown to over 1000 lines, making it difficult to maintain and understand. The file contained multiple responsibilities including:

- Session management
- Runner initialization and configuration
- Event processing
- Memory API
- MCP tools loading
- Utility functions

This monolithic structure made it difficult to modify specific components without affecting others.

## Solution

The file has been split into a package structure with dedicated modules for each responsibility:

- `session/__init__.py` - Package exports and documentation
- `session/session_runner.py` - The main SessionRunner class for managing ADK Runner instances
- `session/session_manager.py` - The SessionManager class for managing multiple sessions
- `session/event_processing.py` - Functions for processing different ADK event types
- `session/utils.py` - Utility functions for response processing and timestamps
- `session/memory_api.py` - Memory API and routes for storing memories
- `session/dependencies.py` - FastAPI dependencies for session and runner management
- `session/serialization.py` - Serialization utilities for handling complex objects
- `session/mcp_tools.py` - MCP tools loading functionality

The original `session.py` file now acts as a facade that imports and re-exports the components from the individual modules.

## Implementation Details

The refactoring was implemented using a dedicated script (`tools/split_session_module.py`) that:

1. Extracts different components from the original file using regex patterns
2. Creates the appropriate directory structure
3. Adds proper imports and file headers to each module
4. Updates imports between modules to maintain functionality
5. Replaces the original file with a simplified facade that imports from the new modules

## Benefits

This modularization provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Each module has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to specific functionality can be made in isolated files
3. **Better Collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
4. **Clearer Dependencies**: The import structure makes dependencies between components explicit
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Each file is now under 500 lines, improving code navigation

## Usage

All public components are re-exported through the original `session.py` file, so existing code that imports from `radbot.web.api.session` will continue to work without changes. For new code, you can either:

- Import from the facade: `from radbot.web.api.session import SessionRunner`
- Import directly from the module: `from radbot.web.api.session.session_runner import SessionRunner`

## Future Work

This modularization makes it easier to:

1. Add additional API endpoints for session management
2. Improve event handling for different event types
3. Extend memory functionality
4. Add unit tests for specific components
5. Further refine the session runner implementation
