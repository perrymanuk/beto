# Sequential Thinking Implementation for Scout Agent

This document details the implementation of sequential thinking capabilities for the Scout agent in RadBot, allowing it to break down complex problems in a structured, step-by-step manner when triggered with the keyword "think".

## Overview

The sequential thinking feature enhances the Scout agent with the ability to approach complex problems systematically. When a user includes keywords like "think", "think through", or "step by step" in their prompt, the agent will activate a structured reasoning process inspired by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Sequential Thinking server.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. A `SequentialThinking` class that manages the thinking process
2. Detection logic for identifying when to trigger sequential thinking
3. Integration with the existing Research Agent framework

### 1. SequentialThinking Class

The `SequentialThinking` class in `radbot/agent/research_agent/sequential_thinking.py` manages the structured thinking process:

- Maintains an ordered list of thinking steps
- Supports linear thinking progression
- Allows for revision of previous thoughts
- Enables branching of thought paths
- Captures a final conclusion

Each thought is represented by a `ThoughtStep` class that contains:
- The content of the thought
- Step number
- Reference to parent thought (for branching)
- Revision status

### 2. Trigger Detection

The `detect_thinking_trigger()` function analyzes user prompts for specific keywords or phrases that indicate the user wants the agent to think through a problem step by step:

```python
def detect_thinking_trigger(prompt: str) -> bool:
    """Detect if the prompt should trigger sequential thinking."""
    thinking_patterns = [
        r'\bthink\b',
        r'\bthink through\b',
        r'\bthink about\b',
        r'\bstep by step\b',
        r'\bthinking process\b',
        r'\breason through\b',
    ]
    
    for pattern in thinking_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, prompt.lower()):
            return True
            
    return False
```

### 3. Research Agent Integration

The `ResearchAgent` class has been enhanced with:

1. A new parameter `enable_sequential_thinking` (defaults to True)
2. A `process_prompt()` method that intercepts user messages before they're processed by the agent
3. A `_run_sequential_thinking()` method that executes the thinking process

When triggered, the thinking process:
1. Uses the same model as the agent with a lower temperature for more deterministic results
2. Breaks down the problem into logical steps
3. Forms a conclusion
4. Stores the thinking process in the session state
5. Makes the thinking output available in the response metadata

## Usage Example

When a user interacts with the Scout agent and includes a thinking trigger word:

```
User: Can you think through how we could implement a scalable caching system for our API?
```

The sequential thinking process is triggered, resulting in a step-by-step analysis:

```
# Sequential Thinking Process

Step 1: Define the requirements for a scalable caching system for an API...

Step 2: Evaluate potential caching strategies...

Step 3: Consider implementation options...

Step 4: Address cache invalidation strategies...

Step 5: Plan for monitoring and maintenance...

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, I recommend implementing a distributed caching system using Redis...
```

## Configuration

The sequential thinking feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting `enable_sequential_thinking=False` when creating the Research Agent.

## Benefits

This implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Structured Problem-Solving**: Helps break down complex problems into manageable steps
2. **Transparent Reasoning**: Shows the agent's thought process to the user
3. **Improved Solutions**: More thorough analysis leads to better recommendations
4. **Better Collaboration**: Users can follow the agent's reasoning and provide feedback on specific steps

## Implementation Details

The sequential thinking capability is implemented in two files:

1. `radbot/agent/research_agent/sequential_thinking.py` - Contains the core logic
2. `radbot/agent/research_agent/agent.py` - Integration with the Research Agent

The implementation is inspired by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Sequential Thinking server, which provides a framework for structured thinking processes.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the sequential thinking feature:

1. Allow users to interactively guide the thinking process
2. Support more complex branching of thought paths
3. Enable comparison of alternative approaches
4. Add visualization of the thinking process
5. Support saving and loading of thinking sessions
