This directory contains documentation for specific functional components of the RadBot system.

## Contents

- [Agent Components](agent/index.md) - Specialized agent implementations

## Overview

Components are self-contained functional modules that provide specific capabilities to RadBot. Unlike core modules, which form the foundation of the system, components can be added or removed more independently.

Each component documentation file describes the implementation details, architecture, and usage patterns for that specific feature set.
