# MCP Implementation Update for ADK 0.3.0

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to update the MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation to work with ADK 0.3.0 without maintaining backward compatibility with older ADK versions.

## Changes Made

1. Updated import statements to use the new ADK 0.3.0 module structure:
   - Changed `from google.adk.agents import QueryResponse` to `from google.adk.events import Event`

2. Updated function return types:
   - Changed return type annotations from `QueryResponse` to `Event` in:
     - `_handle_fileserver_tool_call_async`
     - `handle_fileserver_tool_call`

3. Updated response object creation:
   - Changed `QueryResponse(function_response={...})` to `Event(function_call_event={...})`

4. Updated exports in `__init__.py`:
   - Added `Event` to the imports and exports to maintain proper module interface

## ADK 0.3.0 Structure Changes

ADK 0.3.0 introduced several structural changes, including:

1. Moving response-related classes from `agents` module to `events` module
2. Renaming `QueryResponse` to `Event`
3. Changing the parameter from `function_response` to `function_call_event`

## MCP Client API Changes

The MCP Python SDK API has also evolved, with changes to the client interface:

1. The `Client` class from `mcp.client` has been renamed to `ClientSession` and moved to `mcp.client.session`
2. Client initialization now requires a transport object (like `stdio_client`)
3. The client must be explicitly initialized with `await client.initialize()` after creation
4. The `Tool` class has moved from `mcp.server.lowlevel.tool` to `mcp.types`

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the MCP fileserver functionality should work correctly with ADK 0.3.0 without any compatibility layers or shims.
