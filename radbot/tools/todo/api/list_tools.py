def list_project_tasks(project_id: str, status_filter: Optional[str] = None, include_done: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Retrieves a list of todo tasks for a specific project.

    Fetches tasks associated with the given project, which can be specified by either
    a UUID or a project name. By default, completed tasks ('done' status) are excluded
    unless explicitly requested with include_done=True or status_filter='done'.
    Tasks are returned ordered by creation date, newest first.

    Args:
        project_id: The project ID or name whose tasks should be listed. Can be a UUID or a project name. (Required)
        status_filter: An optional status to filter tasks by. Accepted values are
                       'backlog', 'inprogress', or 'done'. If omitted, tasks of all
                       active statuses (not 'done') are returned.
        include_done: Whether to include completed tasks in the results. Default is False.
                     If status_filter='done', this parameter is ignored.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the list of tasks or an error message.
