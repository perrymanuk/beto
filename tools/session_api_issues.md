# Session API Issues

The `session.py` file already uses the new ADK 0.4.0+ patterns for the most part:

1. It correctly uses `Content` and `Part` objects from `google.genai.types`
2. It uses the `runner.run()` method to get events
3. It has an event processing loop to extract responses

However, there might still be some issues to address:

1. Check for any direct `generate_content` calls that bypass the Runner
2. Ensure all event types are handled correctly
3. Verify the session service is properly initialized
4. Make sure circular references between agents don't cause problems in session serialization

## Recommended Approach

1. Add diagnostic logging to track the flow of messages
2. Verify that events are being generated and processed correctly
3. Watch for any errors in the event processing loop
4. Consider implementing a more robust event handler system
